This is a silly little rust project to demonstrate that it's not safe
to check the first few/last few characters of a sha256 hash. It simply
brute forces them. Must be a multiple of 2 characters for start and
end of the hash. (Simply because it's a silly poc I wrote when I was
bored and I didn't want to make it better)

Usage:

cargo run --release -- FILENAME 1234 56
